This repository lets you use your micro:bit as a screen for an arduino (tested with a micro:bit V1 and arduino nano 33 ble but it should work on every micro:bit and arduino) with 3 pins.<br><br>You can copy and paste the microbit.js in the micro:bit's code. <br>Replace every occurence of /\*PIN CONNECTED TO MICRO_BIT'S Px\*/ with the actual pin in arduino.ino.<br>
If the micro:bit gets stuck in an infinite loop press any of its buttons to manually exit the loop.
